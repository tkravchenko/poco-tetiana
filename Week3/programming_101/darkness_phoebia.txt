Task

One family wants to get through a tunnel. Dad can make it in 1 minute, mama in 2 minutes, son in 4 and daughter in 5 minutes. 
Unfortunately, not more than two persons can go through the narrow tunnel at one time, moving at the speed of the slower one.
Can they all make it to the other side if they have a torch that lasts only 12 minutes and they are afraid of the dark?

Solution

GetThroughTheTunnel

    Initialization step:
    maxTime = 12;
    totalTime = 0;
    peopleLeft = 4;
    datTime = 1;
    momTime = 2;
    sonTime = 4;
    daughterTime = 5;

    Sorting time per person to find fastest and slowest:
    SortTimePerPerson() => result:array sortedTimePerPerson[] = [1, 2, 4, 5]

    SelectTwoFastest(): numbers from  fastestArray[] sortedTimePerPerson[] with index less then 2=> sortedTimePerPerson[0], sortedTimePerPerson[1]
    SelectTwoSlowest(): numbers from  slowestArray[] sortedTimePerPerson[] with index grater then 1 slowestArray[] => sortedTimePerPerson[2], sortedTimePerPerson[3]

    Creat function time per pair:
    TimePerPair(time1, time2):
        return max(time1, time2)

    Going through tunnel:
    
    Step 1: 2 fastest are going
        totalTime = totalTime + TimePerPair(fastestArray[0], fastestArray[1]);
        peopleLeft = peopleLeft - 2;

    Step 2: fastest is going back
        totalTime = totalTime + fastestArray[0];
        peopleLeft = peopleLeft + 1;

    Step 3: 2 slowest are going
        totalTime = totalTime + TimePerPair(slowestArray[0], slowestArray[1]);
        peopleLeft = peopleLeft - 2

    Step 4: fastest is going back
        totalTime = totalTime + fastestArray[1];
        peopleLeft = peopleLeft + 1;

    Step 4: 2 fastest are going 
        totalTime = totalTime + TimePerPair(fastestArray[0], fastestArray[1]);
        peopleLeft = peopleLeft - 2;

    Check if all the requirments are met:
    If ((totalTime <= maxTime) && (peopleLeft == 0))
        print("Success! You all made it!);
    Else
        print("It's a pity, you didn't make it. Try again!");
    End If

End GetThroughTheTunnel
