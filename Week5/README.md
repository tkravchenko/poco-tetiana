 ## The DOM and HTML
 The document object is globally available in your browser.
It allows you to access and manipulate the DOM of the current
web page:
1. Find the DOM node you want to change
2. Store this DOM node as a variable
3. Manipulate the DOM node:
- Change its attributes
- Modify its styles
- Give it new inner HTML
- Append new nodes to it
